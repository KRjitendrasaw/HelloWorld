Last Updated : 08 Mar, 2019

In this article, we are going to discuss a Natural Language Processing
technique of text modeling known as Bag of Words model. Whenever we apply any algorithm in NLP,
it works on numbers. We cannot directly feed our text into that algorithm. Hence,
 Bag of Words model is used to preprocess the text by converting it into a bag of words,
  which keeps a count of the total occurrences of most frequently used words.

This model can be visualized using a table, which contains the count of words
corresponding to the word itself.
